    <h1>Text formatting</h1>
    <p>There are three types of formatting. those are: <b>bold</b>, <i>Italics</i>, and <u>Underline</u>.  </p>

    <h2>Inline vs. Block Elements</h2>
    <p>A <b>block element</b> moves the content to a new line. The paragraph and headers elements are block elements. An <b>inline element</b> keeps its content on the same line as the content before and after it. It dose NOT create a new line. The bold, italics and underline elements are inline elements.</p>

    <h3>Block example</h3>
    <p>This is a paragraph.<p>This is another paragraph. it makes a new block.</p>
    <p>This is an example of a nested block element. <p> This is a nested block</p> </p>

    <h3><u>Inline element examples</u></h3>
    <p>This is a paragraph with <b>an inline element</b>. Notice how the inline element dose not move to a new line.</p>

    <h2>Vertical spacing</h2>
    <p>There are two elements that help with vertical spacing between block elements. A <b>line break</b> moves the content down to a new line. its similar to the <i> ENTER</i> key in Word.Docs. A <b>Horizontal rule</b> is a line break which includes a horizontal bar across the page. both are block elements</p>

    <p>Bellow this paragraph is a line break.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Above this paragraph is a line break</p>
    <p>Below this paragraph is a horizontal rule.</p>

    <h1 style="color: #f05454">Attributes</h1>
    <p><b>Attributes</b> are properties which can change an HTML element. Attributes are written in the opening tag of ANY html element. The most common attributes are <i>src</i>, <i>href</i>, <i>class</i>, <i>id</i> and <i>style</i>.</p>

    <h2>Inline CSS Styles</h2>
    <p>The <i>style</i> attribute allows you to add CSS style to any HTML element.</p>

    <p style="color: #ff0000">This paragraph has inline CSS style which changes the font color to red.</p>

    <p style="background-color: steelblue">This paragraph has inline CSS style which changes the background color.</p>

    <p style="color: lightsteelblue; background-color: slategrey">This paragraph has inline CSS style which changes the font color <b>AND</b> the background color.</p>

    <p style="font-family: Jokerman">This paragraph has a different font type.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 48px">This paragraph has a larger font size.</p>

    <p style="background-color: #222831; color: #dddddd; font-family: 'Edwardian Script ITC'; font-size: 72px">This paragraph has all 4 inline styles.</p>

    <h1 style="color: #f05454">Images</h1>

    <p>An<b> is a <i> block</i> element which inserts pictures into the document. An image element is a self-closing element which means it dose not have an end tag. It has one attribute, src, which is a filepath that points to the images location. Those filepaths can be either <b>absolute</b> or <b>relative.</b></p>

    <h2>Simple Image Example</h2>

    <h2>Images Attributes</h2>
    <p>There are 4 attributes commonly used for images. <i>width</i> and <i>height</i> are used to resize the images. <i>alt</i> allows to use text-description of image for accessibility and broken images. <i>title</i> allows a hover-over text to appear.</p>

    <h3>Width and Height</h3>
    <p>The width and height can be measured in many different ways, but the more common ones are pixels and percentages. Using pixels, you set the specific, precise size based on pixels. using percentages, you set the dimensions based on a percentage of the entire page. Percentage based re-sizing will often respect aspect ratio while using pixels may not.</p>

    <h3>Alt Attribute</h3>
    <p>EVERY picture should at LEAST have the alt attribute. The alt attribute helps with screen readers for visually impaired users and in the cases that the image is broken</p>

    <h2>Relative vs. Absolute</h2>
    <p>An <b>absolute</b> filepath includes all the navigate to get to the server, folders and files. The example above are all absolute filepaths. An absolute filepath is used when the image is stored on a different server or devise than the HTML document. </p>

    <p>A <b>relative</b> filepath only include the folder and file. The examples below are all relative filepaths. A relative filepath is used when the images are stored alongside the HTML document.</p>
