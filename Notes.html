    <h1>Text formatting</h1>
    <p>There are three types of formatting. those are: <b>bold</b>, <i>Italics</i>, and <u>Underline</u>.  </p>

    <h2>Inline vs. Block Elements</h2>
    <p>A <b>block element</b> moves the content to a new line. The paragraph and headers elements are block elements. An <b>inline element</b> keeps its content on the same line as the content before and after it. It dose NOT create a new line. The bold, italics and underline elements are inline elements.</p>

    <h3>Block example</h3>
    <p>This is a paragraph.<p>This is another paragraph. it makes a new block.</p>
    <p>This is an example of a nested block element. <p> This is a nested block</p> </p>

    <h3><u>Inline element examples</u></h3>
    <p>This is a paragraph with <b>an inline element</b>. Notice how the inline element dose not move to a new line.</p>

    <h2>Vertical spacing</h2>
    <p>There are two elements that help with vertical spacing between block elements. A <b>line break</b> moves the content down to a new line. its similar to the <i> ENTER</i> key in Word.Docs. A <b>Horizontal rule</b> is a line break which includes a horizontal bar across the page. both are block elements</p>

    <p>Bellow this paragraph is a line break.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Above this paragraph is a line break</p>
    <p>Below this paragraph is a horizontal rule.</p>
